-   Initial scaffolding and data model setup. This is a work in progress
    and is not yet ready for use.
-   The model for the Denig manuscript currently tracks pages, text, and images. 
    The current unit for a single page is at the line level so we can track 
    footnotes and other annotations. 
-   The model also tracks translations (original German, modern German, and English)
    and the relationships between the translations. These are also tied to the 
    pages.
