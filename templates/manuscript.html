                Ludwig Denig created a devotional text—an illuminated manuscript—by mixing an array of Christian elements with his own creativity. He copied passages from the Gospels in German with devotional reflections on the Passion. He painted watercolor scenes from the Passion that combined the stories of the Gospels with scenes from his own experience, including the brutal violence against the Conestoga Indians in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and his own experiences of warfare in the Revolutionary War. And he added Christian hymns to his watercolors and biblical texts.

                Transcriptions of the Old German and translations in English are available for each manuscript page. Don Yoder, PhD first published full translations in his 1990 book,The Picture Bible of Ludwig Denig: A Pennsylvania Emblem Book (New York: Hudson Hills Press for the Museum of American Folk Art), taking a wonderfully lyrical approach. New translations by Jeff Bach, PhD err on the side of a more literal interpretation, even when this produces lines that can, at times, read a bit more stilted. The project team decided this approach offers a close adherence to Denig’s word choice and eighteenth-century voice. Click on each image to view transcriptions and translations. Some pages contain links to forensic analyses performed by scientists and conservators, while the music section includes links to recordings performed by Christopher Dylan Herbert and an ensemble of musicians and downloadable versions of each of the musical settings, transcribed into modern notation with editorial notes by Herbert.
